# ExpressAppExercise-TS-Njs
An exercise in creating a very simple express driven webapp using Nodejs and Typescript

To run the app run the following commands:

npm i
yarn dev

The app will listen on http://localhost:3000

This was an exercise in refreshing my knowlege of express and I have left in the process of refactoring for future reference.
